# 📚 NYT Bestsellers Web App

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a **Next.js** web application that fetches and displays the latest **New York Times Bestsellers**. It includes an interactive navigation bar with dropdowns for **Authors** and **Categories**, allowing users to browse books efficiently. The app dynamically updates its content based on API data and includes real-time notifications when bestseller lists change.

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in **React, Next.js, API integration, UI/UX design, and dynamic content rendering**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📖 **Bestsellers List:** Displays the latest NYT Bestsellers dynamically.
- 🔍 **Categories Dropdown:** Browse books by category.
- 🖊️ **Authors Dropdown with Search:** If more than 12 authors exist, a search bar appears for easy navigation.
- 🔔 **Real-Time Notifications:** Alerts users when bestsellers update.
- 🌐 **Responsive UI:** Fully optimised for desktop and mobile devices.
- ⚡ **Fast Performance:** Utilises server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side fetching for optimal speed.

This project showcases **frontend expertise** in **React, Next.js, UI development, and API integration**, demonstrating:
- **Strong state management and performance optimisation**
- **Intuitive and responsive UI with dynamic dropdowns**
- **Best practices in modern web development**

It serves as an excellent example of **real-world problem-solving**, perfect for roles in **frontend engineering, React development, and UI/UX-focused positions**.
